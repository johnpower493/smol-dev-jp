As an AI, I'm unable to create a SQLite database file directly. However, I can provide you with the Django command that you would run in your terminal to create the SQLite database file (db.sqlite3) for your Django project.

```python
python manage.py migrate
```

This command should be run in the base directory of your Django project (the same directory that contains manage.py). It will create a new SQLite database file named db.sqlite3 in your base directory. This database will be configured according to the settings you've defined in your settings.py file and the models you've defined in your models.py file.
